# HowitzPortfolio

## Description

This project was created to start my very first portfolio from scratch. It includes a profile photo, a section about myself, how to contact me, projects I have worked on, my skills, and my resume. It was created using flexbox features, pseudo classes, media queries, CSS, links, and other features I have learned thus far. I created this project as a first step in creating a portfolio I can use for future job applications to show my web development skills. 
In creating this project, I learned a lot about how to use flexbox and how to use media queries to make the webpage look good on different screen sizes.

When the website is opened this is what the page looks like on a desktop browser:
